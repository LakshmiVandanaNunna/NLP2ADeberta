460,00:48, Yes i'm a pessimist okay
461,00:53, Do you have any plans to change for me to computer science
462,00:57, Actually i'm from i'm from computer engineering computer science anything so my major is a master's in computer anything
463,01:05, Okay so from supercomputer in insurance to you is objects

594,04:51, yeah so yeah
595,05:00, he's waving no let's i'll stop this so once a stopping and the meeting will get the recording and all the transcripts and links
596,05:01, Okay
597,05:04, Okay again will join again will die okay
598,05:06, No problem yeah
599,05:12, Okay maddening the meeting
600,05:13,Okay
601,01:01,Yes I can
602,01:02,hey what's going on
603,01:04,don't get how are you
604,01:06,How
605,01:06,Are you doing in this class so far
606,01:10,um well considering I put like 80% of my grade into the project I feel like i'm doing great
607,01:10,it's all like completion and attending class so
608,01:10,Okay I should be
609,01:25,yeah I spread it out a little bit so I put like 40% of the grade into the final project because I don't know how much of it be able to pull off
610,01:25,exactly like
611,01:25,So this is kind of what we're building datsun squares
612,01:25,So I think we can get everything done but the new learning part we'll see how that goes you have to find a proper data Center train this thing on
613,01:49,yeah well I mean hopefully this does something right I mean this is supposed to be dagger for y'all to
614,01:54,yeah yeah correct correct awesome okay so
615,01:54,yeah alright so this is a game of dots and boxes so
616,01:54,So he re's kind of what you see so here are the roles what we're going to do so the goal is to capture an entire box and the way you capture an entire box is to fill in the rectangle around that right you play against a single opponent at least it will be me and you
617,01:54,Okay be careful that you don't create a situation where the other person can capture an entire box right
618,01:54,here's the thing
619,01:54,After you capture a box you get to go again so your turn does not end whenever you capture a box
620,02:47,seems like
621,02:49,it's a cyclical situation where you just keep capturing boxes over and over again right okay okay
622,02:49,and whoever has the most boxes at the end essentially wins
623,03:00,Okay seems simple enough
624,03:02,awesome awesome let's make sure that
625,03:02,Share okay alright so we're gonna play this game on this particular little website
626,03:02,Solomon if you're watching this instead of using your drawings Well this is much more interactive for us and much easier to set up rather than draw things so this is where we'll do it okay so let's play the game
627,03:02,he'll be with other people to five by four is a pretty decent grid
628,03:02,or right yes it's a private game alright so i'm going to go and share this thing with you on chat
629,03:42,awesome
630,03:45,There you go if you will please join the game
631,03:47,horse
632,03:48,There we go i'm ready
633,03:48,to play by five rounds let's see if you can get up to speed within
634,03:48,five rounds okay
635,03:57,Okay i'll try my best
636,03:58,Okay so my turn I will connect here
637,04:02,Okay
638,04:07,There we go
639,04:07,wow
640,04:13,Ah
641,04:14,yeah that's exactly how it works
642,04:14,Okay so
643,04:14,Since I connected I get to go again
644,04:14,You think this is simple but this thing has like a ton of strategy behind it
645,04:40,yeah I wonder what do you understand was when this particular game was invented
646,04:44,I don't know exactly when this thing was
647,04:44,Interesting yeah yeah yeah It is interesting like again it's so simple to play but I went up against the computer a few times and man it just rolled me every single time
648,04:44,I think I think I want one game yeah
649,05:02,wow
650,05:02,I wonder what type of what type of Ai they use for their
651,05:02,system so
652,05:07,dominating it's it's it's gotta be a Min Max
653,05:07,yeah it's got to be a simple a simple decision trees can get this done because computers very efficient at forcing you into back moves
654,05:22,And to do it is I would assume it would be very fast so
655,05:22,It makes sense
656,05:30,We go
657,05:30,Forward starting to get filled
658,05:32,getting close at some point we have to make a
659,05:36,Yes
660,05:36,yeah
661,05:39,There we go
662,05:39,interesting
663,05:39,it's like the how good you are is all about these patterns that you create
664,05:39,And then you force your audience to have to connect
665,05:39,To make these moves to to connect yeah
666,05:39,um yeah okay
667,05:39,that's one let's see
668,05:39,let's see what's a good thing yeah
669,06:26,There we go
670,06:36,Thank
671,06:39,You wanna you want to try to minimize
672,06:41,The damage you minimize what they can do
673,06:44,minimize what they can do yeah
674,06:44,Exactly so that's probably a pretty good so that's
675,06:44,Okay
676,06:44,You missed this one I think
677,06:55,Oh dang
678,06:55,Oh wow the rest of them okay so
679,07:03,pretty much create a almost yeah so you'll have to figure out which ones to smaller on this
680,07:03,Okay so this is where they change
681,07:03,Right and I think i'll probably have to give you the rest I don't have any other way out yeah
682,07:25,let's see you but you did miss one
683,07:28,Oh I missed one
684,07:29,yeah
685,07:37,yeah
686,07:38,give you that last one though okay
687,07:38,No you have to start you understand oh wait Oh it was me okay
688,07:38,yeah sweet
689,07:45,What you have to go
690,07:47,So 1010 it's a draw
691,07:48,hey whoo
692,07:53,yeah let's do it okay
693,07:53,This is coming through out here
694,07:53,Is the hell
695,08:05,Okay let's see my turn all right let's go
696,08:09,Okay
697,08:12,not going to give you a free box this time
698,08:12,So have you been at you empty your whole college lifetime
699,08:24,yeah pretty much pretty much yeah
700,08:24,I actually started the master's program back in 2007 but due to personal reasons I just never able to finish it
701,08:35,Okay oh you're in the master's program currently
702,08:38,yeah okay
703,08:39,cool
704,08:40,it's my final class actually
705,08:42,Oh well congratulations that's awesome
706,08:45,graduating yeah yeah mommy
707,08:45,awesome Thank you
708,08:51,How did you like the the course as a whole
709,08:51,or
710,08:51,The degree plan
711,08:59,I was a little bit all over the place I like I didn't focus on it's like jack of all trades master of none right like instead of going all oh no no
712,08:59,it's click there's nothing okay
713,08:59,Your turn again
714,09:18,cool
715,09:18,um So if you started it so long ago
716,09:18,Is your master's program like
717,09:18,Specifically or is it more general because I know the masters and Ai is very recent
718,09:34,Oh yes it just there's no
719,09:34,09:3 9there's no specialization like I said I took a little bit of a island with cybersecurity a little bit of
720,09:34,So I believe that way the degree plan work is you got to take some core classes from each group you know those groups that they have
721,09:34,And then you can take whatever you want but these days I think I don't know if you agree or not maybe better to just focus you know really focus in on okay hang up let me
722,09:34,Concentrate on yeah I don't know where to move here i'm not seeing a move without giving you a
723,09:34,box okay and do that
724,09:34,Oh no way that will give you the whole thing
725,09:34,Okay I guess i'll just have to give you that
726,10:34,Okay okay
727,10:34,not bad I think the one I saw was this
728,10:42,doesn't give you yeah yeah
729,10:44,That doesn't give me
730,10:46,so bad move on my part okay now i'm gonna have to all right I think
731,10:46,I think this is the smallest one yeah
732,10:46,I think these days it's better to just
733,10:46,Give
734,10:46,To get a masters in a more stuff wise feel I don't know like I said
735,10:46,Maybe focus it on focus on software development
736,10:46,It looks like i'm gonna have to give me the rest I think you've got this round
737,11:27,i'm a quick learner
738,11:29,ok
739,11:29,Okay awesome
740,11:29,Okay play again more
741,11:36,One more
742,11:37,Oh yeah
743,11:39,yeah i'm starting in the fall hopefully i'm planning on getting the masters and I hear you empty but from what I was looking at what
744,11:39,seemed it seemed narrow enough that it didn't have that same
745,11:39,issue that you were talking about
746,11:53,Well that field is blowing up it's a ton of jobs lots of research opportunities depending on what you want to do
747,12:02,seems exciting
748,12:23,Interesting shape here
749,12:25,We almost have like perfect symmetry
750,12:25,Ah so perfect
751,13:07,Like literally one click might do the entire
752,13:15,God i'd love to see the
753,13:17,algorithm for this computer replaces
754,13:21,See you were giving me one
755,13:21,i'm giving you one I hope it works out for me
756,13:21,Okay
757,13:49,That seems to be yeah
758,13:49,wow
759,14:03,Literally
760,14:05,I literally like one this click fills the entire board we played this
761,14:05,Okay
762,14:05,Okay I can't do anything here I have to take that
763,14:05,I think the rest is yours I don't see around this
764,14:32,huh
765,14:35,hear
766,14:36,Anything I feel in a straight
767,14:39,Line okay I don't see any way to prevent okay
768,14:39,Maybe
769,14:39,we'll play a
770,14:52,Good game
771,14:54,and
772,14:55,that's an interesting word
773,14:58,yeah that was that was
774,15:01,it's all about creating those patterns and hold it into it okay So what do you think is three pretty good or should we play a few more
775,15:01,I think we got them again got enough for these three right
776,15:14,I agree
777,15:14,Okay okay
778,15:16,awesome so let me let me I said I know you recommended a game that i'm not all that familiar with so let me look
779,15:22,down yes and then if you can explain the
780,15:25,You can explain that to me
781,15:25,Of course we can we can play that long So here we go right you can still see my screen
782,15:34,Right yeah again okay okay
783,15:37,There we go
784,15:37,Alright alright play with friends all right let me put this on here we go copy let me put it on chat
785,15:37,There we go
786,15:54,john the game
787,15:56,See
788,15:56,On in
789,15:56,Okay
790,16:05,So this is
791,16:07,This is this game is called connect for so what you're going to do is every
792,16:11,Turn it's
793,16:12,Counting down so i'm gonna go ahead every turn you have to click a column and it drops down to the bottom spot I can go
794,16:12,So your goal is to connect four dots in a row and we're trying to stop each other from doing it and the main aspect here is that it works the graphics you don't get to just choose the spot and the grid
795,16:29,Also it drops down through the whole thing
796,16:32,yeah and it to the last spot at the barn I can go yeah
797,16:36,Okay I get it so connect four circles together
798,16:40,So the first to do that is the winner
799,16:43,and which we kind of go like
800,16:43,me directly
801,16:46,and go up and down Left and Right and
802,16:46,sideways
803,16:52,Okay
804,16:53,Okay I think I understand
805,16:56,awesome
806,17:00,This
807,17:01,What are you getting close there
808,17:01,you're almost there
809,17:07,i've got three right there
810,17:07,Oh okay that makes sense OK OK OK
811,17:07,OK Hello all right that makes sense so we all right now I get to try again
812,17:20,Now you understand the concept a little bit more yeah
813,17:23,For sure
814,17:23,got
815,17:23,It looks like we alternate terms and going first okay
816,17:23,Okay so I can't allow that during
817,17:38,Almost gotcha okay okay
818,17:38,Thank you for step ladder
819,17:47,I can do vertical to
820,17:47,Vertical and diagonal right
821,17:47,hmm okay so
822,17:47,Let me try the oh die okay so
823,18:02,geez okay awesome
824,18:02,it's the same concept like you know the game that you
825,18:07,Like trying to
826,18:07,Make your person to a wrong mess
827,18:11,or wrong so okay so
828,18:11,Okay Okay so I go first here all right gotcha
829,18:11,see that stepladder effect is really critical
830,18:11,That is sneaky sneaky okay
831,18:44,All right wow you're getting the hang of it though you're getting there it's good
832,18:48,Okay all right thank you oh it's so much
833,18:52,more interesting
834,19:16,Can just give me another draw possibly if nobody makes up for
835,19:20,Yes if we filled the board without anyone connecting forward then that would be a draw
836,19:25,Okay gotcha
837,19:25,No can do that
838,19:51,can't get you too many times
839,19:55,interesting
840,19:55,This thing should have some background music
841,20:20,Right and some good like smooth jazz or something
842,20:20,Oh so close
843,20:35,I didn't even see it
844,20:35,Okay how about one more heaven I think it's good enough
845,20:35,awesome this this game moves a bit faster than the other one
846,20:35,Does excellent Okay but hey I got better that's been
847,20:47,instantly lose yeah yeah you're I could see that you you know you're looking at a few steps ahead
848,20:47,Oh you almost got me there
849,20:47,Oh I forgot that was over there
850,22:03,Okay
851,22:45,Nice
852,22:45,Good game
853,22:47,Good game good game
854,22:47,awesome okay
855,22:47,All right
856,22:47,I think that's the end of screen sharing
857,22:47,I think that's all we need to see right
858,22:57,yeah I think so
859,22:58,let's stop awesome Okay no let's look at our instructions
860,23:05,We stop the recording

890,01:37, We do insurance brokering for a specialized specialty you know real estate
891,01:46, And I do catastrophe modeling for them so basically you know understanding how models are done
892,01:51, For me right and we execute you know models for
893,02:00, Her game severe thunderstorms earthquakes you know to see him what you know real estate losses can be based on those
894,02:03, that's good yeah
895,02:08, Okay okay yeah let's start the games
896,02:10, What you're doing doctrine boxers
897,02:12, i'll explain you
898,02:14, Know based on the game
899,02:15,Okay
900,02:22, So I share you the link
901,02:23,Okay
902,02:38, So what this game is like you need to make a square so we will have access will keep drawing drawing the lines
903,02:40, Where we completed the box is going to me
904,02:45, How many more boxes a person will make so he's going to
905,02:47, I am ready sir
906,02:49,yeah
907,02:53, star okay
908,02:58, So just we need to randomly placed lines
909,03:05, Okay So whoever will finish the box he'll get that box so finally who will make more boxes haldeman
910,03:06, OK I see
911,03:08, you've already played
912,03:08,yeah
913,03:18, You should not give me an opportunity to make this say no I made the box

931,05:48, Do we have to do something like write a message or something
932,05:51, Nothing like that I just
933,05:56, limit the video
934,06:00, let's plan
935,06:17, play again
936,06:20, There is one more game we have to play a
937,06:23, game I am sharing a tic TAC toe
938,06:35, tic TAC
939,06:37, toe
940,06:39, You

960,08:09, Sharing you the link
961,08:20, Let go let go
962,08:52, You know my strategy and I stay away from you
963,08:53,know
964,08:59, The now i'm stuck
965,09:09, I guess player one is
966,09:10, going to

992,13:00, All right
993,00:43,yeah
994,00:45,And you see the transcript being
995,00:45,broadcasted yes okay
996,00:45,So
997,00:45,I guess we could start off with a small talk i'll know what to say
998,00:45,Are you an undergraduate student are you a Grad student Daniel masters or what
999,01:02,Yes i'm doing my masters
1000,01:02,masters with a major in Ai
1001,01:09,So is this your first to your a UN tea
1002,01:13,Yes this is my first year at USD and I started just this semester in spring
1003,01:19,Oh wow okay
1004,01:19,Where did you transfer from
1005,01:23,I mean I didn't
1006,01:25,i'm not sorry transfer I mean where did you get your bachelor's from
1007,01:28,So I got my bachelor's way back seven years back from India
1008,01:28,And I just traveled in December last December
1009,01:28,and start my master's this Jen
1010,01:43,Okay that's me
1011,01:43,How about you so I am
1012,01:43,I have not gotten my bachelor's yet now I am in the process of doing so
1013,01:43,I am a senior so I should wrap up by not
1014,01:43,I should wrap up by December
1015,02:04,that's cool
1016,02:06,No
1017,02:07,and your major isn't artificial intelligence
1018,02:12,The major is computer science
1019,02:12,Okay and then you can pick and choose what courses you want to take
1020,02:12,After you know like upper division electives once you reach your once you reach Grad school then you could do select which track you want to go to but you don't have that
1021,02:12,choice you start to take all your fundamentals along the way you know his bachelor's yeah
1022,02:36,So I mean
1023,02:36,what's your favorite subject or
1024,02:36,You know like something that keeps you going is during your free time as well
1025,02:51,I have no free time outside of class or work because i'm also doing an internship
1026,02:51,And that keeps me busy all day as well
1027,03:04,how's the internship going
1028,03:06,it's Nice that it's remote but it's
1029,03:06,it's it's a lot of work
1030,03:14,yeah
1031,03:14,yeah so you have started this internship remotely because of the band
1032,03:19,Yes I started in the summer and it's extended all the way through while i've been coming to you went to
1033,03:24,that's Nice
1034,03:24,And how was the experience like you you feel that you've changed since being done started
1035,03:33,yeah I mean you get to learn all the basic like all the stuff you learned from school I it makes more sense once you apply to the real world
1036,03:33,yeah and then get to work in a corporate environment and
1037,03:44,yeah
1038,03:47,push out the little things you you get the hang of things how
1039,03:47,Things actually happen in the industry
1040,03:52,yeah there's a lot of documentation and jira and confluence and
1041,03:52,And then
1042,03:52,The small incremental changes one at a time but you're constantly releasing yeah it's it's it's good
1043,04:05,what's the walk about
1044,04:05,What do you do
1045,04:09,um so as a developer and turn this is the company happy financial they are Washington based company and they are insurance broker brokerage
1046,04:09,So what they do is sell
1047,04:09,Life insurance policies
1048,04:09,on behalf of different life insurance companies to prospective customers
1049,04:09,So it's like they're the middlemen and they use a lot of technology to do so
1050,04:09,They have their own sales staff and stuff but they use the CRM custom CRM software called lists
1051,04:09,And that's a lot of the work i've been doing and they do a lot of integrations with new advertising partners and
1052,04:09,They have their own phone number system or not phone number system they work with phone number
1053,04:09,Companies that can
1054,04:09,handle all of these calls at scale
1055,05:11,With chase before
1056,05:11,coming here to start my program here
1057,05:11,So I work with
1058,05:11,On I used to work on trading platforms so corporate trading platforms
1059,05:25,Like
1060,05:28,Like Bloomberg I mean Bloomberg
1061,05:28,kind of provides market data
1062,05:28,For chase I mean not just purchase but anybody it kind of words like good quality data on the market data
1063,05:28,from all over the markets from to make all the markets in the world
1064,05:28,And I like Asian markets we will Marcus from everywhere and all the you know
1065,05:28,I mean instruments that are being traded in all of the currencies
1066,05:28,Right so
1067,05:28,So there's Bloomberg and then we have multiple vendors like moody's and stuff
1068,05:28,So they keep the data so chase has its own platform but when I say platform it's not like
1069,05:28,it's not like the you know it's not the market but it's it's provides a platform for its customers who can trade via churches who can buy instruments via change right and also it gives you the school graphs like it does all of this you know data filtering and
1070,05:28,Then yes they give all of these vendors given good data but again they do a lot of data cleanup and then they suggest stuff and then they show how they you know how they're doing in a market and all that yeah I was I was in Java
1071,05:28,And spring boot and on them so machine learning is pretty new to me but because i've worked with that application I really understood the BAT I mean like where this is going where everything is going
1072,05:28,In the next two decades I don't like I don't I think it's in the next decade it's going to be like
1073,05:28,there's going to be a lot of revolution in you know in
1074,05:28,My machine learning and there's too much data that's what I see
1075,07:14,huh yeah
1076,07:17,it's good to know you
1077,07:18,yeah it's nice to meet you are you um I don't know how we can show the emotions so I guess this is my confusion face i'm showing right now
1078,07:18,I can look at any other emotions without switching over the screen
1079,07:38,Let me do that
1080,07:39,Okay
1081,07:41,Well we're supposed to
1082,07:41,be supposed to be neutral
1083,07:52,Okay i'm pretty neutral I don't think you can really see my face but yeah i'm pretty neutral
1084,07:59,yeah and then this curiosity
1085,08:03,That yes we did display that okay
1086,08:07,And then there's boredom
1087,08:10,Okay
1088,08:13,And then there's happiness
1089,08:17,Okay
1090,08:19,Then there's anger
1091,08:25,hahaha how we're gonna show anger But OK
1092,08:29,And then there's confusion
1093,08:31,I just showed it
1094,08:34,Good sadness
1095,08:38,I mean I guess if I lose the Church
1096,08:41,And then this concentration maybe we can put that
1097,08:41,I don't mind the hand you're kind of
1098,08:41,thinking
1099,08:41,And there's surprise
1100,08:41,Then there's anxiety
1101,08:41,hey
1102,09:08,yeah I don't think I can do that
1103,09:11,Then this disgust
1104,09:16,That can be done
1105,09:17,The opposite
1106,09:19,We can we could fake it because like you there we go there's discussed
1107,09:23,yeah
1108,09:23,And then there's restlessness
1109,09:27,All right
1110,09:29,And then there's drowsiness
1111,09:31,yeah pretty cool i'm feeling pretty sleepy though
1112,09:31,Okay
1113,09:36,I think we're done
1114,09:37,yeah let's go through the game so
1115,09:37,Why don't capture the plugins mean but from what I understand this is a copy of the game scores board and this is a classic game board
1116,09:37,game board
1117,09:37,With dots and boxes
1118,09:37,i'm not sure if you played it before but the objective of the game is to capture as many squares as possible
1119,09:37,So like
1120,09:37,Each person will make one mine
1121,09:37,Like that will be mine Now this is yours and then
1122,09:37,Mine and then whoever is the one who completes a square
1123,09:37,May capture that box so I guess I could fill it in
1124,09:37,You know what let me actually share this with you too
1125,09:37,yeah I think yeah
1126,10:36,So it doesn't matter who did the three sides it matters who finishes the fourth side
1127,10:42,that's right
1128,10:42,Okay
1129,10:42,So at the very end of the game you count whoever has more squares and the other person
1130,11:03,yeah so the person who does more squares wins it right
1131,11:07,that's right
1132,11:08,And every time you finish a square I think we have to log it somewhere because your lines and my lens everything looks the same and we can
1133,11:15,yeah I think we can well
1134,11:15,The color of the line doesn't necessarily matter it's whoever owns the box and matters and I think we can fill it in
1135,11:25,yeah yeah
1136,11:25,that's cool yes we can do that yeah
1137,11:30,Something like this
1138,11:38,I guess I don't have access to it I just requested access
1139,11:55,Okay try refreshing your page yeah
1140,12:00,yeah
1141,12:02,Okay
1142,12:06,So should we start
1143,12:07,yeah
1144,12:09,guess ladies first
1145,12:09,Oh are you able to color it
1146,12:26,I didn't
1147,12:26,want me to color
1148,12:29,Oh no i'm seeing a color okay
1149,12:31,I think I can see that in the screen but
1150,12:31,At my end I don't see in film
1151,12:31,And I see your line
1152,12:40,is good
1153,12:47,So one thing I forgot to specify is that whenever i'm captured his square they could to play one more turn
1154,12:59,yeah
1155,12:59,I don't have a strategy i'm just drawing lines
1156,13:24,that's basically what i'm doing to
1157,13:31,me really bad games and I played cut down with my friends and I always use
1158,13:31,i'm always news
1159,13:55,me recently that
1160,13:55,don't
1161,13:55,Control I just take control yeah
1162,13:55,That was a good move
1163,15:42,Oh my God okay
1164,15:42,I just saw that there's a big square but
1165,15:48,yeah
1166,15:49,I just finished a squared but
1167,15:49,it's not the kind of square uh
1168,15:54,huh
1169,16:06,The game is going to get pretty tight
1170,16:06,The last safe line somebody can draw
1171,16:27,yeah I think so
1172,16:27,Okay let's
1173,16:27,Put a shape in there
1174,16:48,Sorry
1175,16:48,A shape
1176,16:56,shape or something to indicate that it's yours
1177,16:59,yeah
1178,17:07,yeah
1179,17:07,Okay I get to draw another line right
1180,17:07,yeah there's kind of a punishment I guess now that
1181,17:07,choice
1182,17:19,I want to say you fell for my trap but
1183,17:22,Oh my God
1184,17:23,No there's
1185,17:23,Not thinking very deeply in this at all
1186,17:23,it's more pure luck
1187,17:23,So go ahead
1188,18:05,I guess we have to do a lot of talking so that we get a lot of
1189,18:08,transcript
1190,18:08,I guess yeah
1191,18:10,It is more about
1192,18:11,The transcript
1193,18:13,Well it's a couple of things
1194,18:13,The video being on that green screen
1195,18:13,yeah and the emotions are for some
1196,18:13,yeah collection of something
1197,18:26,So sorry i'm just taking too long
1198,18:26,To make this move
1199,18:39,I think that's the best movie could have made here
1200,18:39,Okay
1201,18:39,let's see
1202,18:39,I guess there's no other way around it now
1203,19:20,yeah
1204,19:20,I didn't find any other options that you can miss giving a point to the opponent everything seems tight
1205,19:20,Did you watch that goal game that alphago play
1206,20:31,i've
1207,20:31,Back in 2013
1208,20:31,The first half ago games against
1209,20:31,yeah I think I saw those
1210,20:31,in Korea yeah was it third 2013 that's what happened or 2014 2015
1211,20:48,yeah
1212,20:49,yeah
1213,20:51,Okay it's still your move
1214,20:55,yeah study
1215,20:57,But yeah I did watch the game
1216,20:57,And I learned
1217,20:57,I already knew kind of how to play go before that and then I learned some more i'm not very good do you want to play go next
1218,21:12,After this
1219,21:13,yeah because we have to play two games
1220,21:13,I don't necessarily have to be a different games
1221,21:19,I mean I I don't know game I am I mean I don't know go I just saw that and and I really find it critical to understand like okay there's a pattern or I mean whoever occupies like a lot of territory and all right so
1222,21:33,yeah
1223,21:39,yeah that's true
1224,21:39,I guess
1225,21:43,No you just place to another one so another lining you got a box
1226,21:48,Okay this goes on it's not like there's a limit to it
1227,21:48,Yes every time you're finished something you have to do something
1228,21:55,that's right least that's my understanding of it pretty sure that's right yeah cuz you can have long chains if I remember correctly
1229,21:55,you're stuck in that dilemma yeah give me something
1230,22:31,yeah
1231,22:33,yeah
1232,22:33,there's no there's no real
1233,22:43,yeah I think it's end game now
1234,22:45,yeah let's do it
1235,23:07,Another arrow
1236,23:07,i'll give you this one
1237,23:27,Why is it
1238,23:42,So I suppose you just contact the left to him and give up
1239,23:42,Something and i'll take to you
1240,23:42,and give up something
1241,23:42,you'll take to you live something
1242,23:42,So are you in denton
1243,24:11,Right now i'm in San Antonio it kind of moves denton and Sam to focus somehow this is not coming up
1244,24:20,yeah that's fine
1245,24:20,it's because there's that
1246,24:20,corner yeah
1247,24:20,doesn't need to be perfect as long as we can talk
1248,24:39,Because of that
1249,24:39,Okay let me just try to
1250,24:44,I think a line got deleted
1251,24:47,yeah
1252,24:47,yeah you got it
1253,24:47,that's fine
1254,24:47,I guess put circles and then another
1255,24:47,replace the line
1256,24:47,Okay
1257,24:47,I guess i'll put their their
1258,24:47,Last one is
1259,24:47,This last one is yours
1260,24:47,Did you say something to me
1261,27:42,Where did you draw the last one
1262,27:45,The last line I drew it
1263,27:50,yeah I guess at the top right
1264,27:52,Yes
1265,28:41,Just mess up Oh did I place the wrong thing in the wrong place
1266,28:41,Oh I think that cost me the game
1267,28:41,that's fine though
1268,28:41,Well there's disappointment
1269,28:41,Okay
1270,28:41,Because this is all yours now
1271,29:16,This is
1272,29:16,To win that game
1273,29:37,There you go first time
1274,29:43,I guess it's just this weakness no
1275,29:48,No I you know I mean not to but I think I mean I made a mistake there
1276,29:48,Okay it is 11 against seven
1277,29:48,Your favorite so you won that game you want to play again or do you want to play a different game
1278,30:09,Everything is fine
1279,30:12,Do you want to learn how to play go go it takes a long time though maybe we can play a small board
1280,30:17,yeah
1281,30:18,Let me see i'll have to find it
1282,30:18,part you know what this is too much pain let's just play another game of this
1283,30:28,yeah something like this something simple
1284,30:35,nurse there's an eraser option
1285,30:40,I guess you can just select all and then delete
1286,30:43,My don't want to delete the the dots either
1287,30:48,Okay want to stick with the same game
1288,30:48,let's get a new sheet this
1289,32:11,I think this is even a bigger board this time
1290,32:14,yeah
1291,32:20,there's a dodo page
1292,32:20,Okay yeah
1293,32:20,want to start this time
1294,32:31,Okay well you one so I guess you okay
1295,32:31,I don't know the rules there
1296,32:38,OK
1297,32:52,that's fine
1298,33:20,I saw the article did some experimental moves right
1299,33:26,alphago um they trained on a bunch of games and then they discovered that it produce some useful insight that other humans aren't really doing
1300,33:26,Yes then alphago zero came along and it just
1301,33:26,It was an adversarial network
1302,33:47,And it
1303,33:47,was a very big
1304,33:47,very big thing I mean it's
1305,33:47,It was a very big like this media and then this this player and it's
1306,33:47,Very heavy that he lost and it's like
1307,33:47,The entire nation is watching
1308,33:47,That game the sky it's very spiritual to them
1309,34:09,uh huh
1310,34:10,That I guess in that document yes or that like
1311,34:10,Sorry it's my turn okay you just do right
1312,34:18,Yes now it's yours I think yes
1313,34:18,What what
1314,34:18,alphago
1315,34:18,There is a lot of
1316,34:18,Processing power that be done
1317,34:18,A lot of training that button
1318,34:18,you're hindering the I mean
1319,34:18,I think during the matches they had like a
1320,34:18,Year very powerful computer there
1321,34:18,Oh you just played okay
1322,35:31,You drew the line no
1323,35:32,Yes I did I did it in the second row in the
1324,35:32,Third space
1325,35:40,yeah
1326,35:40,that's dangerous
1327,35:40,Having
1328,36:02,they're all dangerous
1329,36:02,There we go
1330,36:12,Oh my God
1331,36:12,going to end well for somebody
1332,36:12,it's going to be a very bad game for
1333,36:12,Attack mode i'm just playing defensive
1334,36:51,I mean there is no attack Defense right now we're just want to make shapes
1335,36:51,And just not
1336,36:56,Making very bold moves like all the sequential stuff that you did and then you're creating some kind of
1337,37:02,yeah just now am I saying okay there's a zigzag can do not be fun it looks like a maze
1338,37:07,yeah
1339,37:30,i'm sure it does came as strongly solved there is probably a strategy you can force
1340,37:30,tic TAC toe is strongly salt
1341,37:47,yeah
1342,37:57,you're going along with this you're saying that i'm making all the dangerous moves but you're going along with it to you making them to
1343,38:07,finish this for you
1344,38:07,And I drew that line
1345,38:07,Okay just drew one line in the second row is it
1346,38:18,Yes
1347,38:20,i'll go vertical line right
1348,38:21,Yes
1349,39:05,I guess the last time we played
1350,39:05,They were less number of rows right
1351,39:05,Now it's interesting
1352,39:05,You draw a line now right
1353,39:21,Yes yeah
1354,39:21,A good player will be able to read into this and calculate okay
1355,39:57,yeah
1356,40:00,I don't want to think it's too late
1357,40:02,yeah
1358,40:03,it's almost nine o'clock on a Thursday
1359,40:10,One mistake here is going to cost
1360,40:10,Real bad
1361,40:17,Maybe
1362,40:27,yep
1363,40:27,I think we have did
1364,41:49,um yeah I think know how to let people
1365,41:49,recover it with all the easy moves
1366,42:12,A lot of things now
1367,42:13,Maybe
1368,43:30,there's still another box you can take
1369,43:30,Do you see
1370,44:00,Oh God just give me a moment just lose this
1371,44:06,there's still another line
1372,44:08,yeah the box okay
1373,44:09,Okay
1374,45:02,Oh if you
1375,45:02,have this might lead me to take everything around yours
1376,45:08,yeah
1377,45:08,I don't know
1378,45:59,yeah I don't see a way out
1379,46:02,yeah i'm done let me just
1380,46:02,When you can go ahead and
1381,46:02,i'm just filling out the shoes
1382,46:12,Okay
1383,46:22,I guess I should do all the lines first
1384,46:22,That means I have is I mean I have this oh
1385,46:22,yeah this is brutal
1386,46:38,yeah
1387,46:51,I still have other lines or continue
1388,46:51,that's came
1389,47:01,I lost pretty bad
1390,47:04,I guess I got lucky in that
1391,47:04,You had to take those pieces
1392,47:11,yeah
1393,47:13,And I guess the way the whole
1394,47:13,I mean we just do random stuff we didn't have a strategy and
1395,47:13,20 and Friday right
1396,47:50,yeah
1397,47:50,I mean I know for sure everyone because of luck
1398,48:07,Good I have played this maybe differently I mean the last line that I drew if I would have drawn i'm the one that you started with the parameter finish that line
1399,48:07,anyways it I don't think it would have made a difference because
1400,48:07,desktop the stuff is like a chain reaction
1401,48:07,it's just lane away from
1402,48:07,becoming the box
1403,48:32,yeah
1404,48:37,I guess where you could have done was not take dissenters and try to burn
1405,48:37,Online off to the side
1406,48:46,yeah
1407,48:48,i'm not sure if that would have worked
1408,48:49,yeah
1409,48:54,redemption
1410,48:54,Okay
1411,48:54,i'm gonna stop the share now
1412,48:54,Do we have anything else to do
1413,49:08,document
1414,49:20,Oh there's triumph I did show triumph
1415,49:23,yeah
1416,49:27,If you know
1417,49:27,If they can actually detected with this bad lighting
1418,49:33,yeah
1419,49:33,So I guess once we end this call will have the recordings with us
1420,00:27,All right
1421,01:01,Can you request access to this new Doc
1422,01:01,You check if you
1423,01:33,got it yes yes I can access the document
1424,01:38,Okay
1425,01:40,Good
1426,01:42,All right
1427,01:53,hi
1428,01:53,and I guess we're in this class together but are you in any other classes
1429,02:05,Yes I mean does it in this process processing plant
1430,02:05,Apart from this artificial intelligence and taking digitally miss purchasing class as well and the next class he is individual research as a PhD student support and how about you
1431,02:25,um i'm wondering now I finished my undergrad long Barclays seven years back and then i've been working with multiple mcs mostly in banking developing trading applications and transaction applications and then I got God
1432,02:25,You know curious about data analytics and then how things are going on
1433,02:25,and see how things are going to progress in the next few years with all this data and how I mean what kind of change it can bring in well I just thought i'd do masters in Ai
1434,03:07,yeah
1435,03:07,Exactly sounds good
1436,03:07,yeah So for me i'm doing my PhD
1437,03:07,In computer science engineering PhD
1438,03:07,PhD right
1439,03:07,computer science and engineering so my concentrates and he's basically in autonomous vehicles self driving cars
1440,03:07,So i'm currently we're trying to build
1441,03:07,Self driving cars and we are we are almost
1442,03:07,I think we're better
1443,03:07,Almost halfway
1444,03:07,To building autonomous vehicle and by ourselves and hopefully by the end of the Semester we will be able to showcase the whole project and to the end community as well
1445,03:54,No that's
1446,03:56,It
1447,03:58,And I guess that's a lot of hard work late me yeah
1448,04:00,A lot of it's been almost a one and a half here that we're working on the project and basically started from
1449,04:00,Building the vehicle itself and now all the you know inside the stuff with the programming controlling the vehicle and all the hard work is going on so yeah
1450,04:21,Hopefully by the engineering staff so you have people working on the vision
1451,04:25,And toys yes
1452,04:25,We have a group of
1453,04:25,More than 10 students who are working on you know respective fields and trying to you know
1454,04:25,bring all those things together and build a good platform
1455,04:44,it's amazing
1456,04:46,Oh my God it's really exciting
1457,04:48,All right or you can come to visit our laws we have a vehicle in there and I can do the small suitcase
1458,04:56,Okay so your vest is located at the discovery park
1459,05:00,Yes behind the cafeteria
1460,05:03,Okay
1461,05:03,i've been doing discovery park
1462,05:05,yeah twice
1463,05:08,So you must be
1464,05:10,Connected all because of the pandemic
1465,05:12,yeah right so this is your first year here in the
1466,05:17,Midwest and Mr That is why that is why
1467,05:19,That is the reason why
1468,05:19,All right now I guess we can start
1469,05:26,yeah so
1470,05:26,i'll be I don't think we need to share the screen
1471,05:33,Oh yes I don't think
1472,05:34,yeah we just We just need the video
1473,05:34,Okay right and I I didn't turn on the transcript I guess I turned it on like two minutes into the meeting so
1474,05:47,That yeah that'd be fine
1475,05:49,So you are on this page
1476,05:53,I believe so yes
1477,05:53,Yes
1478,05:56,Yes good
1479,05:58,So this board is called
1480,05:58,The West board the game is basically you know typically it's played by two players
1481,06:10,and
1482,06:13,Here you will see that there's a matrix of dots
1483,06:13,And you all you have to do is draw a line
1484,06:13,connect dots obviously not diagnosed
1485,06:13,But vertical and horizontal lines you can draw a vertical and horizontal lines
1486,06:13,And then
1487,06:13,I mean you could draw a line and then I could draw a line we could draw lines any way we want to do
1488,06:13,rice and then if you see a box coming in
1489,06:13,Right when I say a box it's not like a box that's connecting the bigger leaving out some dots inside the box that's not the case so you need to find for ages and dots and then that's a box
1490,06:13,And then if you see three lines already drawn if you finish the fourth line if you finish your boss you can put your label inside that some shape or whatever
1491,06:58,So that
1492,06:59,One that box
1493,07:01,All right
1494,07:01,And by the end of the game whoever has the most number of boxes wins this game
1495,07:07,Alright alright sounds good
1496,07:09,And then once you're done with the box I mean
1497,07:09,You have to draw a line each time when you're done comes and then if in your turn
1498,07:09,If you draw a line and finish your box and then label the box you when the box
1499,07:09,You have to draw another line every time you win a box you have to run a deadline
1500,07:09,that's one of the reasons
1501,07:09,to play with the rules right
1502,07:09,Yes okay so let's start the game will you can start first is your question
1503,07:36,Alright so we have to draw the line right
1504,07:36,Okay
1505,07:36,about this
1506,07:36,Okay see the line
1507,07:48,yeah looks good yeah
1508,07:50,All right
1509,08:02,Oh wait
1510,08:11,yeah
1511,08:19,it's your turn okay
1512,08:19,Nice working
1513,08:19,straight line
1514,08:19,From my side
1515,09:22,Dun
1516,09:32,Dun
1517,09:50,yeah
1518,10:10,Was that the last
1519,10:10,I think so right
1520,10:10,I think there's we still got one more before we start labeling things out
1521,10:10,This one not this one
1522,10:10,not this one
1523,10:10,not this one this one
1524,10:10,I guess that was the last one
1525,10:40,Maybe
1526,10:41,yeah
1527,10:44,yeah just give you one
1528,10:56,yeah
1529,11:57,alright
1530,11:57,X box
1531,11:57,Also another one right
1532,11:57,text box
1533,11:57,And also another one
1534,11:57,So basically you can draw as many yeah I says we want right okay
1535,11:57,This one
1536,13:07,I wanted to place the line somewhere and then I miscalculated and I placed it
1537,13:13,yeah
1538,13:13,Another one
1539,13:13,I think that's it now I have to give you
1540,13:13,One line right
1541,13:45,yeah
1542,13:47,All right
1543,13:50,it's yells the most minimum are the least
1544,13:50,boxes
1545,13:50,isn't have one
1546,13:50,I think that gives you maximum two boxes
1547,14:30,yeah
1548,14:32,That should have been my
1549,14:33,yeah
1550,15:11,waiting for you there was another option for you to write your label but you missed it I guess I can use that
1551,16:03,That was a strategic move
1552,16:05,yeah That was good that was
1553,16:05,yeah I was just I was wondering why you did that
1554,16:17,That was a good you
1555,16:19,You caught me off guard
1556,16:21,All the Games I when I do this kind of
1557,16:28,I think you have all the remaining boxes under your level now
1558,16:34,yeah just go ahead and draw the line
1559,16:38,If there's any other thing any anything I can do
1560,16:38,yeah I don't think there's
1561,16:38,Anything I can do
1562,16:38,Alright I give up
1563,16:38,I guess you won the game
1564,16:38,That was a nice move
1565,16:38,That was a great
1566,16:38,thing
1567,17:23,I actually um
1568,17:23,So I didn't play this game before and then I
1569,17:23,I started playing with our classmates So the first game that I played
1570,17:23,I won I won that game and that was with some one of this kind of move
1571,17:23,mm hmm but the other person he knew I mean
1572,17:23,He had he didn't have any option so he he had to let it go but he knew you wouldn't know because is you just played now but that guy is kind of a protein he knows the game so he knew that i'd made a good mood and it was a good move there before
1573,18:07,Right
1574,18:12,So cool it's
1575,18:14,94123 yep
1576,18:21,yeah That was a good game
1577,18:21,Right oh
1578,18:25,what's the next game the
1579,18:28,Next game
1580,18:28,yeah anything in mind
1581,18:28,What was the games that he played before
1582,18:40,You could do checkers
1583,18:40,So go for it
1584,18:40,Give your profile a name I mean once you just go there give yourself a name so that I
1585,18:40,tell me what name you gave there so that i'll send you a game request
1586,19:08,All right
1587,19:09,You mean I have to create a
1588,19:09,New
1589,19:14,ask you what name you want to give to your
1590,19:14,Can you click on hockey player
1591,19:20,All right he has a son
1592,19:29,named it to the
1593,19:30,yep
1594,19:32,I should be able to see no
1595,19:37,decline
1596,19:41,Yes I see you now can you accept that
1597,19:41,Okay good so we are in the game
1598,19:41,Alright so this is checkers
1599,19:41,uh huh it looks like chess if you see the Board and the structure of it so you see your coins and then you see mine and going can only move diagnose right like you have this to the coin you see that it's in a
1600,19:41,brown squared right
1601,19:41,That this coins can only move in brown squares Mitch which means they can only move diagnose
1602,19:41,Left or Right doesn't
1603,19:41,By the coin cannot come back it only can move forward
1604,19:41,Okay and then
1605,19:41,So if somebody coin is there in the diagonal
1606,19:41,Right and then if you jump over that you can jump over that coin
1607,19:41,Like ideally you can move only one space right once
1608,19:41,But if somebody is kind is there you can jump over the guy
1609,19:41,And you know you can go to the other
1610,19:41,The second one and then this you win that coin you take away that coin
1611,19:41,Okay so we'll get some more coins they win and also if you're able to go to the other end of the board
1612,19:41,To this blue squares if you're able to go to the last blue I mean brown square that's there on the other end of the board
1613,19:41,your mind becomes a king so once it becomes a king it can play backwards as well right now all of this
1614,19:41,can only move forwards diagonally
1615,19:41,That coin can move like diagonally in all directions
1616,19:41,Okay
1617,19:41,All right
1618,19:41,Let me just send your request this kind of
1619,19:41,I don't see you here
1620,21:39,Where
1621,21:40,yeah I mean it just because of the time lapse it just it's gone can you send me requests go to multiplayer and set try to send me a request if you see me there because I don't see you there
1622,21:51,Okay
1623,21:53,we're already paying
1624,21:53,Close
1625,21:53,multiplayer
1626,21:53,Give me a second yeah
1627,22:21,yep I see you accepted
1628,22:21,Great so let me make my
1629,22:21,yeah
1630,22:21,yeah
1631,23:11,done
1632,23:29,yeah
1633,23:55,yeah
1634,26:11,Right
1635,26:11,This is the first time i'm playing this game
1636,26:47,This is my second
1637,26:47,learned it
1638,27:08,So the first rule playing any game is you don't think too much
1639,27:16,yeah
1640,27:21,When
1641,27:23,it's time now
1642,27:26,All right
1643,27:26,I think that's it
1644,27:28,yeah
1645,27:29,So that's good i'm
1646,27:29,Recording
1647,02:48,Yes I can see
1648,02:48,that's what was happening before and actually now on yours I can see the option but I didn't see it online
1649,03:01,Okay
1650,03:02,Maybe with the setting
1651,03:03,That I was wanting to come again
1652,03:08,You can see the option on your
1653,03:11,transcript
1654,03:47,What do you want to do which one
1655,03:53,Do you need to turn on your camera
1656,03:55,Oh i'm sorry
1657,04:03,Should I start sharing
1658,04:07,And then put the
1659,04:09,yeah
1660,04:12,So you have the Texas right
1661,04:15,The one
1662,04:18,On this
1663,04:20,side we look
1664,04:22,At Texas edit
1665,04:22,Okay yeah
1666,04:30,So just tell me when you're going to start recording and when you're going so
1667,04:34,it's already been recorded
1668,04:36,Oh okay
1669,04:37,yeah I try not to record
1670,04:39,All right so this is
1671,04:39,This is
1672,04:39,We call it boxes right there we see boxes within boxes so in order to play you just go up and down and left and right you can't do diagnose once you complete a box you can do you get another move but it's for the most part just you
1673,04:39,So
1674,04:39,You want to go first
1675,05:17,yeah
1676,05:17,I just had a late lunch and
1677,05:17,Then had some ice cream
1678,05:44,Well I cut my hair my case here
1679,05:44,Even watching so
1680,05:44,I haven't gone through
1681,06:02,yeah
1682,06:12,Nobody
1683,06:35,I just feel really guilty after eating ice cream
1684,06:37,Oh
1685,06:42,Well they're making really low carb ice cream that's actually
1686,06:54,That
1687,06:55,wasn't that wasn't definitely not the low the low carb
1688,07:01,I wasn't eating that I was eating the totally totally flip fat fat is good
1689,07:09,Good stuff
1690,07:19,you're just you're just finished trying
1691,07:28,Trying to win this one
1692,07:37,i'm just trying to see if there's any other option
1693,09:00,Oh
1694,09:00,i'll stop
1695,09:00,Trying
1696,10:24,I have to pay for my mistake
1697,10:24,Bad score
1698,10:35,ultimate failure of the class
1699,10:35,I don't think
1700,10:35,it's
1701,10:35,ready yet you and I got working
1702,10:52,yeah
1703,11:01,Oh should we go back to that yeah
1704,11:03,yeah so let me go back to
1705,11:03,Yes
1706,11:03,yeah
1707,11:35,So this is
1708,11:35,The object of the game
1709,11:35,skip pieces to take the pieces at the skip them oh
1710,11:48,yeah
1711,11:49,When by taking everybody else's pieces to get to the end to be a king and you can move
1712,11:49,backwards and
1713,11:49,Right
1714,12:03,yeah
1715,12:16,type of ice cream
1716,12:16,My favorite is chocolate chip my children will actually
1717,12:16,come upon
1718,12:16,You don't like it right
1719,13:13,flavor I mean that's a very odd combination
1720,13:17,brushing your teeth
1721,13:19,Oh my God no I I don't like it
1722,13:19,or hate it more now
1723,13:19,yeah oh God
1724,13:30,that's relatively up for the flavor I would I would have to say but it's something that I would always even as a child and even though there were a lot of different flavors that I like
1725,13:30,really like cherry chocolate chip rocky road you name it I like it all
1726,13:30,But yeah mint chocolate chip I feel pretty odd choice
1727,13:30,Especially for a kid and both my kids are all called up a little
1728,14:02,surprised
1729,14:25,mouse do you like your
1730,14:25,House a little much

1734,14:52,yeah just
1735,14:58,Imagine surprises MAC book is new in one MAC book thing it's
1736,14:58,it's actually it doesn't have a touch screen I don't know if I accidentally ordered that way but
1737,14:58,kind of keep one in the only other laptop touchscreen that one's not really
1738,14:58,close to the top of the line
1739,14:58,kind of your around the USA
1740,16:19,summer is here because it's already too hot and the sun is very harsh
1741,16:19,And i'm from India and i'm from India and i'm saying that the summer is to me like this sadness too harsh imagine oh my God
1742,16:33,You know what i'm not you know think about it the hottest place on earth is actually in the United States a couple of states over the valley is the
1743,16:44,zona I mean is it somebody in Arizona
1744,16:46,it's called
1745,16:46,The hottest place on I
1746,16:46,Also think about it yeah good the equator is
1747,16:46,You know we're close to the equator than that balance
1748,16:46,Okay all right so we went so we can I when we
1749,17:19,click the record you want to games
1750,00:06,yeah hi Simon
1751,00:07,How are you doing
1752,00:09,don't you

1757,00:23, yeah hear me
1758,00:25, Okay
1759,00:28, So how did your first semester go
1760,00:33, I only took like two classes because i'm also working
1761,00:42, I took the software element Ai and empirical analysis last semester I went well actually
1762,00:50, And then the second semester so after this some strategy completing total only like four subjects
1763,00:56, i'm not doing like three subjects per Semester and taking it slow how about you
1764,00:58, Oh so you had been bad
1765,01:15, yeah i'm considered I think it is full time i'm basically you know studying on transfer international student but i'm studying on H1 visa so there are no strict requirements for me like the fun with the students like I need to take at least three subjects like that
1766,01:17, Okay okay
1767,01:20, Okay great it's good man
1768,01:22, yeah yeah
1769,01:24, So you're new to the country as well
1770,01:27, yeah I just added this semester
1771,01:29, Okay good luck good luck
1772,01:31,Thank you
1773,01:34, that's good this you know game started
1774,01:36,Okay
1775,01:40, So which came first
1776,01:43, You found something read the
1777,01:48, caption Polygon let's start with that and then we'll play another online game
1778,01:50, Okay
1779,01:52, So
1780,02:00, Okay so let me reach the terminal okay so
1781,02:02, you're blessed
1782,02:05, Okay yeah I can do that yeah
1783,02:09, Okay so I ran some brand side card and the angle good for you
1784,02:11, Okay it just put it
1785,02:16, aside 2010
1786,02:18, Say 20 an angle
1787,02:20, So
1788,02:23, This
1789,02:30, Okay so site card is 20 right
1790,02:41, So we have total 24 234 so you've got a wild card that means you can choose any property of your choice
1791,02:44, Any property of decide
1792,02:45,yeah
1793,02:49, What are all the possible sides like
1794,02:51, Like
1795,02:57, Maybe you can say to one side is equal or
1796,03:02, You can say that I can choose which has four sides that three sides
1797,03:07, I saw their shoes in may make sure that I mean
1798,03:10, You need to to the side says that he will you get most of the
1799,03:12, polygons
1800,03:17, Other is if I look at the angle and then they said on the side which are said you want to go
1801,03:19, Okay what was the angle for me please
1802,03:21, What is that 10
1803,03:26, So
1804,03:32, That means at least one angle is equal to 90 degrees
1805,03:38, At least one is 90 degrees then i'll take anything that has
1806,03:43, Four sides
1807,03:46, which has four sides yeah
1808,03:49, 90 degrees for segments yeah
1809,03:57, Like rectangular square or anything or can I say more than three like that is that possible
1810,03:59, yeah you can choose anything
1811,04:05, Okay let's say 90 degrees and anything that has more equal greater than or equal to three
1812,04:06, Okay
1813,04:09, So
1814,04:11, From here
1815,04:15, So if I choose let's say take a he cannot use the invite
1816,04:23, yeah Okay well then he goes for me and then also there is 90 degrees right
1817,04:30, yeah if it's 90 degrees but see how I did it is no right or if we keep see
1818,04:31, season at
1819,04:36, 1900 with just that aren't tilted it okay see
1820,04:41, I think E F g
1821,04:43, head
1822,04:45, Is E F G which
1823,04:47, One minute let me know the
1824,04:50, First pitch he gh
1825,04:53, see it okay
1826,04:57, So how many rounds do we get each ah
1827,05:00, let's live items okay
1828,05:04, it's a big hit and then
1829,05:06, J K l
1830,05:12, is also at the end there is an entity is it my degrees in in
1831,05:17, No no no okay J K l
1832,05:20, Think that's it this page
1833,05:21,Okay
1834,05:27, And then
1835,05:32, think that take us know
1836,05:36, Because that's it
1837,05:41, yeah i'm thinking like
1838,05:45, Always not try it again I believe
1839,05:55, I think way is not it may not be 90 not sure
1840,06:02, Okay Okay then that's awesome you got 123456
1841,06:13, think that wild card was helpful in a greater than or equal to the I don't know if you're supposed to do that but let's
1842,06:14, let's
1843,06:20, let's limit the number of rounds you said five right bubble it's do like three
1844,06:22,OK
1845,06:24, OK now let's
1846,06:27, say this to angle is five
1847,06:41, So do under 345 so at least three acute angles
1848,06:44, means anything as a 90 foot
1849,06:48, For anything less than 93 a good angle so my God
1850,06:50, and
1851,06:54, site is to
1852,06:58, Zero and do has a number of sites
1853,07:05, Okay even number of sites this one does not look like a real fun game it is more like intellectual
1854,07:11, Actually this is for kindergarten students so they can learn geometric shapes
1855,07:12,Okay
1856,07:17, For masters we are going back because
1857,07:21, No
1858,07:25, Less than 45 and even less than 90 and even number of sites
1859,07:32, Less than 90 minutes even bs right 12345 no not be has only five sides
1860,07:38, By 678 could take the
1861,07:41, yeah the
1862,07:45, The 123
1863,07:47, If cannot be taken
1864,07:50, Whatever it
1865,07:57, Is for sides it has less than and you're right here be can be taken yeah
1866,07:59, The e
1867,08:05, F is I think not even number of sites right is odd number of sites 123
1868,08:07, and a half I think
1869,08:10, Okay then finally the he
1870,08:19, had to catch as well I think I can be taken D I know at least i'd say ignore it a
1871,08:22, sense Okay be the end right
1872,08:25, yeah the that page
1873,08:29, Okay one second base
1874,08:41, What is this 5512 345-671-2345
1875,08:50, actually be good to pee pee is it six or 7123477 okay
1876,08:53, one
1877,08:55, Is can be taken
1878,08:58, Yes okay yeah yes you
1879,09:01, It deals are going to take and it has four sides right
1880,09:04, yeah yesterday you
1881,09:08, You and V as well
1882,09:11, I don't yeah
1883,09:16, yeah we as well yeah we have the left side it is less than 90 I think yeah it's not like perpendicular
1884,09:20, St you the right
1885,09:27, Yes the UV right right 123456 how about X
1886,09:31, X I guess only to a good angle said they're
1887,09:34, Not at least one academics enough read
1888,09:36, At least three
1889,09:38, Just reacted angles
1890,09:40, yeah okay
1891,09:44, St UV Okay and then
1892,09:48, St UV and why it
1893,09:51,Was molly yeah okay
1894,09:58, way OK
1895,10:01, OK
1896,10:06, ready for us de St 12345678 yeah
1897,10:09, Just make a note eight
1898,10:10,I guess
1899,10:15, yeah he didn't need a beach
1900,10:20, yeah should even limited to to to you know lead status around lead next and then we'll see how it goes yeah
1901,10:21,Okay
1902,10:28, Then 15 and 11
1903,10:36, So this 15 so it is not a coordinate
1904,10:39, Okay
1905,10:43, Not a quarter little means more not for
1906,10:45, Less
1907,10:48, than four sites
1908,10:52, yeah you can take which has four sides
1909,10:53, not equal to force it so
1910,10:55, yeah and then
1911,10:56, And then
1912,11:04, You can steal polygons from one up or down based on the angle property
1913,11:10, You can wait oh steel polygons from one opponent
1914,11:11, yeah
1915,11:17, Based on the angle property Oh I can miss one angle property means what
1916,11:24, So any angle property you can say that so I can transfer this ball against
1917,11:27, Okay I could angle
1918,11:38, So I guess you can
1919,11:42, hear apart from that you can steal from me
1920,11:45, yeah options
1921,11:47, Oh I can either choose from you or
1922,11:49, You can do but
1923,11:50, Oh yeah
1924,11:56, It close to four and acute angle
1925,11:57,yeah
1926,12:02, d I can take a writing them
1927,12:05, yeah you can dig deep
1928,12:07, In that sit here scroll down
1929,12:11, And then I can also take
1930,12:20, I can take a look here right acute not equal to for help
1931,12:22, yeah you can take DL
1932,12:26, Be m
1933,12:29, The Liam yeah
1934,12:32, I think n is all more than 90 I think
1935,12:37, There is one angle which is less than empty right
1936,12:40, think it is more than 90 probably
1937,12:43, But it's not perpendicular
1938,12:50, I guess this will be right angle yeah this is a good only this angle
1939,12:54, The angle but you're showing
1940,12:57, Thinking less than then
1941,12:58, Okay
1942,13:00, Then whatever it is
1943,13:02, But it also return it
1944,13:06, Okay Okay the LM
1945,13:08, What else
1946,13:10, The l m
1947,13:13, I think be
1948,13:16, Okay blm p
1949,13:17, To
1950,13:26, him he killed
1951,13:28, them to take it from there yeah
1952,13:28,yeah
1953,13:32, yeah this is the last race
1954,13:33,T
1955,13:38, T can be taken
1956,13:52, Not for 1234 T and then this is it Z can be taken these it
1957,13:57, And then I think he'll second 1234
1958,13:58, yeah
1959,14:01, For such a DNS data that's it yeah
1960,14:03,Okay
1961,14:07, awesome you
1962,14:11, need to take it from yes
1963,14:12,Okay
1964,14:17, Good me completely like it's
1965,14:21, Okay no it's might
1966,14:24, Do and make
1967,14:26, It is zero
1968,14:29, I mean one is nothing but zero
1969,14:36, I guess directly so
1970,14:39, It will be
1971,14:42, At least one make you tangle
1972,14:43,aka
1973,14:48, And what I would say zero at least five saves
1974,14:51, More than five will do the acute
1975,14:54, phase is
1976,14:58, Greater than or equal to take everything for a call Center taken yeah
1977,15:00, yeah bs okay
1978,15:03, All right think you already to be right
1979,15:05, Is it
1980,15:07, Is three
1981,15:10, Be
1982,15:15, Be
1983,15:18, that's it I think only be
1984,15:23, How about all
1985,15:25, taken
1986,15:30, yeah be will be whatever is already taken
1987,15:33, No no be in whoa
1988,15:35,Okay
1989,15:38, Being low and
1990,15:40, You can be taken
1991,15:42, My A B and walk you
1992,15:50, Okay with already taken so yeah can do that
1993,15:57, 234341234 Allah
1994,15:59, yeah
1995,16:01, yeah at least for the record yeah okay
1996,16:03, yeah I guess
1997,16:06, hey I think we can end this game here
1998,16:09, Okay I think a lot more number of polygons
1999,16:11, So you're living 10 revelations
2000,16:12,yeah
2001,16:16, Get A grade I guess
2002,16:25, Okay yeah let's go I think you have you don't pick on it now let's move on to the next
2003,16:26, game this game

2015,17:59, As you play you will see some question mark on this question mark symbol on the board if you hit the question mark then you'll get the
2016,18:03, More access to more access to more weapons now you're
2017,18:10, going to use him Israel let's see

2024,18:50, Oh my God
2025,19:26, Now I got one question mark she I think we destroy on board completely let on the question mark no I got one question now if I had to get access to more open
2026,19:27, Okay
2027,19:42, Oh so it randomly
2028,19:44, yeah yes yeah okay

2045,21:00,yeah
2046,21:02, Okay
2047,21:19, Most of the people are not playing this game so I guess
2048,21:25, The thing I don't know how to play
2049,21:30, First of all the instruction itself not clear

2125,02:30, Show me up let's go
2126,02:34, He asked me for a secret code
2127,02:37, and asked me for a secret
2128,02:40, A secret
2129,02:46, I think it was 550 OK so now that we've played a game
2130,02:49, Are you creating a tournament or no
2131,02:55, No no I think it's a game tic TAC toe
2132,02:57, yeah we play with a friend
2133,03:00, of rain and you have to see me doing
2134,03:03, Okay and then
2135,03:04, You pause on it yeah

2138,03:19, Well either way yeah
2139,03:24, yeah posted here as well
2140,03:35, OK so now I ended up games and we start playing game so all the emotion
2141,03:39, First first
2142,03:42, I guess you know one Mustafa right
2143,03:43,Okay
2144,03:47, Okay now is me

2150,04:32, wow
2151,04:40, Okay
2152,04:43, Oh you're creating one more game
2153,04:55, screen were so mean the level and my reward
2154,04:57, that's it I think it went away
2155,04:57,yeah
2156,05:02, I think he can play in Google as well
2157,05:07, Like the Google has seen it I don't know if it plays with computer or
2158,05:12, I think it plays with computer star game or select player
2159,05:16, play against a friend there is one here
2160,05:18, Is the similar like
2161,05:23, I am not sure let's see
2162,05:26, I think we have to
2163,05:31, So the first game this is wrong nobody mean
2164,05:35, yeah Oh there are a lot of games here
2165,05:37,No
2166,05:40, matter what you
2167,05:44, need to play the game with you people in play
2168,05:45,yeah
2169,05:53, let's try this one as well or i'll share my screen sorry i'll give control to you
2170,05:55, It can also
2171,06:16, let's go back to that wasting time here
2172,06:18, Sorry
2173,06:22, So what other games do we have here
2174,06:31, So I don't know how to play that we know how to play it
2175,06:33, know which one they go mako
2176,06:39, I think it's already 10 minutes right or no
2177,06:42, Well we need to play two games
2178,06:43, Okay
2179,06:52, I guess really the same tic TAC toe again Madison I don't know how to play it and you don't have to play it
2180,07:03, Because I we need to know how to play that game and you need a plane how the game well for me
2181,07:07, I see I think let's try to maybe first understand
2182,07:14, So how do we play this game
2183,07:21, Okay the oh there there are instructions here
2184,07:24, On and we'll try to
2185,07:25, destroy them
2186,07:26,Okay
2187,07:30, So
2188,07:31, Try to locate
2189,07:33, The straw the books
2190,07:34,Okay
2191,07:36, No
2192,07:40, Nearly two Okay maybe we can
2193,07:44, Try to play in the same time
2194,07:45,yeah
2195,07:49, Okay
2196,08:05, So I really didn't see your boy
2197,08:10, yeah I can't see you oh you're able to see my board
2198,08:11, Because i'm sharing the screen
2199,08:13, Well I don't look at the screen
2200,08:17, So no cheating
2201,08:18,Okay
2202,08:35, Did I know I did not hit any of my board Howard you're still hit any of yours
2203,08:38, mine
2204,08:39,America
2205,08:47, There are controls that down he can there are like couple of museums or something like that you can choose that and then hit me
2206,08:49, Oh okay
2207,09:01, Oh you're tired you are tagged some of it yeah
2208,09:07, there's
2209,09:10, Only like two missiles I think it can use
2210,09:17, Oh so to you and on a weapon
2211,09:18, Maybe I
2212,09:22, said that

2495,09:18, It says every time we
2496,09:25, Like whoever complete the square have another extra room
2497,09:30, So you can feel
2498,09:34, When God is now I did so again if you have an external

3931,00:19,And my primary focus is on graph theory and social network analysis and talking about my hobbies I like watching and things for us I like reading yeah pretty much
3932,00:43,yeah and you go with my introduction
3933,00:50,i'm doing my masters in computer science major
3934,00:50,My primary interested areas are shutting divisions and data science and
3935,00:50,I heard
3936,00:50,My lights are like
3937,01:12,Okay that's all right yeah okay
3938,01:15,i'm taking fundamental so artificial intelligence and data science and programming languages to semester and I haven't written computer algorithms and come to dry picture in the last semester and my goal is to complete my masters with into intelligence systems as my trusted as
3939,01:15,opposed
3940,01:15,To my photo studies
3941,01:15,After my masters and my likes I like I like to do gardening i'd like to i'd like to hang out and my favorite pastime is like sleeping i'm doing

3963,03:36,So this is
3964,03:36,The great septic text oh so about what we can do is we we will be able to mark our points so it's going to be turn by turn so i'm going to mark one ad and then you will have to do the other one and then it leads me to the other one so
3965,03:36,So we ever completely aligned with their marketing wins the game
3966,03:36,So yeah so it can be a reason to Ryan vertical Ryan or a diagonal So if you can make all these three
3967,03:36,marked by yourself then you will win or whoever wins first Oh this is what happened
3968,04:18,yeah
3969,04:21,This is
3970,04:22,yeah

4005,07:07,boy

4293,00:24, i'm a PhD student here in university of North Texas i'm doing my PhD in computer science and engineering department
4294,00:30, My concentration is in self driving vehicles and how about you
4295,00:36, yeah i'm also the PhD student
4296,00:39, In computer science
4297,00:42, This is my second year
4298,00:48, Currently have folks on the story project as well
4299,00:53, Oh so we have the same response feel right
4300,00:57, yeah we have pretty much the same
4301,01:00, Research split
4302,01:03, Right when and I remember we're partners as well
4303,01:06, Right now
4304,01:10, Okay now let's start the game without any further delay
4305,01:12, So i'll go through the
4306,01:20, Different instruction as you can see in the screen different rules that you have to follow in order to play the squares game
4307,01:22, alright
4308,01:35, So this game requires two or more players the first player draws a line from any to any vertically or horizontally at the Center
4309,01:51, Right and the next player does the same thing so you have a draw a line from one to another Doc it should be at this and that means the dod that is right next to the dod that you are starting to draw the line from
4310,01:53, Okay
4311,01:54, Okay
4312,01:59, All right and the bear continue to take turns drawing the line in the same way
4313,02:00, Okay
4314,02:08, Okay y'all did the so basically the goal of the game is to form a square by joining four dots
4315,02:29, So once you join four dots and make a square You can write your name inside and you'll have one point so as many point is you get or as many squares you make you can write as many sales as you want and player with the highest number of initials
4316,02:31, Inside the squares will be the winner
4317,02:33, you're doing okay

4644,06:49, Okay yeah
4645,06:52, Thank you thank you
4646,06:54, Thank you very much
4647,10:52,Live transcript on I just need to go to gallery view.
4648,10:52,Okay.
4649,10:52,Can you hear me.
4650,10:52,Yeah I can hear you
4651,10:52,as well this time.
4652,10:52,My volume up
4653,10:52,so high.
4654,10:52,What the volume.
4655,10:52,The volume is so high.
4656,10:52,Just straight use it.
4657,10:52,I'm not sure why.
4658,10:52,so high volume that's on your ear.
4659,10:52,I'm not
4660,10:52,your output is high
4661,10:53,and your input like I can't hear what you're saying that well.
4662,10:53,It's fine. Yeah.
4663,10:53,So then I have not starting anything just yet.
4664,10:53,I can record to the cloud in just a second. Once we start.
4665,10:53,So you will be explaining the rules right.
4666,10:54,Have you read the sheet.
4667,10:54,They told us to start by introducing ourselves and we need to ask them.
4668,10:54,We need to know each other and.
4669,10:54,Did you see that recording actually some did the recording
4670,10:55,recording. They played the game. Actually did you see that.
4671,10:55,No.
4672,10:55,Okay.
4673,10:55,I think though 98 member in the spreadsheet one.
4674,10:55,They played the game actually.
4675,10:55,And they uploaded it.
4676,10:56,Let's try record it now.
4677,10:56,We have to go through it
4678,10:56,going to be converting transcript to a CSV file like you saw that right by usi
4679,10:56,And then we have to annotate it yeah on part of this is not actually playing e
4680,10:56,Okay.
4681,10:56,Yeah I go to.
4682,10:56,I'm going to start recording no way to say hello and then we'll start.
4683,10:56,Okay.
4684,10:56,Yeah. Okay then you need to ask them basically you
4685,10:57,need to ask what you started recording.
4686,10:57,Okay.
4687,10:57,Okay. Yeah. After just a minute to introduce ourselves right. So after that
4688,10:57,Yeah it says it right there was quite a few actually.
4689,10:57,Then you'll be saying that you're the experienced player and me as the new gu
4690,10:57,Yeah.
4691,10:57,Okay then we just started like that.
4692,10:57,Okay then. I'm ready.
4693,10:58,Hello.
4694,10:58,Hi. Hi. My name is Christopher barnish.
4695,10:58,I'm panda Condotti and so have you are doing.
4696,10:58,Yeah I'm fine.
4697,10:58,So what brings you to the program with what you need.
4698,10:58,Yeah the program I am doing is I zone OCR
4699,10:58,OE the master's program or even.
4700,10:58,Okay. So mine is a master's in computer science.
4701,10:58,And so where are your interest like on what are you working actually work not
4702,10:58,people that have a kind of a vocational job.
4703,10:59,My background is in some analytics work I guess. Well I didn't file physics
4704,10:59,In a lot of molecular modeling.
4705,10:59,It's been a while since I've been back in school with this kind of stuff.
4706,10:59,I was still kind of in an undergraduate program for a while.
4707,10:59,To see this one pop up.
4708,10:59,I thought it was good.
4709,10:59,Oh
4710,10:59,what's what's your background.
4711,10:59,Yeah actually I'm from an engineering background computer science engineerin
4712,10:59,So I further want to pursue my master's degree in computer science and secur
4713,11:00,So what brings me to this particular program or is it the UNT program complet
4714,11:00,I'm checking remotely actually all the classes the semester I'm taking remotel
4715,11:00,Are you finding your.
4716,11:00,Yeah.
4717,11:00,I'm in San Antonio.
4718,11:01,Know what job that he had. Are you out of your undergraduate program.
4719,11:01,Yeah.
4720,11:01,No I didn't have any job actually I want to do my higher studies and then I'
4721,11:01,You have goals coming up.
4722,11:01,internships.
4723,11:01,Yeah I did internship in India actually in the SNL where they taught us about
4724,11:01,or fourth semester.
4725,11:02,I'll try this
4726,11:02,again. But I'd rather go into academia to be honest with you but not in this
4727,11:02,I'm kind of taking this round out my computational basis so that I can go back
4728,11:02,And I haven't quite decided yet but I'm looking into that. There's a couple of
4729,11:02,Just trying to find a place where it can be a part of it.
4730,11:02,And so I guess I've been looking at some internships that not necessarily AI
4731,11:03,Oh that's great.
4732,11:03,So I know you're working right.
4733,11:03,You're working right. At present yes I'm working.
4734,11:03,Okay.
4735,11:03,Work it up.
4736,11:03,Quite a few places Actually I have a business that operates but actually don
4737,11:03,I'm making more doing other things on on the on the side so other things that
4738,11:03,If I were to be there by myself or doing it not by myself.
4739,11:04,So I'm part of the
4740,11:04,policies.
4741,11:04,We don't
4742,11:04,work at it working on.
4743,11:04,Now what
4744,11:04,I was doing high
4745,11:04,do home visits as well. So for for different types of reasons but mostly to
4746,11:04,Those are the ones that kind of take.
4747,11:04,But yeah
4748,11:04,that's great.
4749,11:04,Shall we start again.
4750,11:05,Yeah.
4751,11:05,So this is where
4752,11:05,was this is the
4753,11:05,ski ski ski.
4754,11:05,ski. So the box game. We're making lines to create a box. And once you create
4755,11:05,So the objective is to create a box.
4756,11:05,And if you do create a box.
4757,11:05,Once we get.
4758,11:05,If you don't create a box of that time you don't get another time so we creat
4759,11:06,deviation first letter.
4760,11:06,And then yeah so pretty simple you just make a line one line from one another
4761,11:06,Okay. Yeah I got it.
4762,11:06,Um I guess unmute. So I'll I'll let you go first.
4763,11:06,So we can put some line in there but were you.
4764,11:06,Okay.
4765,11:06,So I will be starting again.
4766,11:07,Oh.
4767,11:07,Oh.
4768,11:07,you're just joining
4769,11:07,us
4770,11:07,class and good looking good.
4771,11:08,Introduction to computer security cryptography and AI.
4772,11:08,com.
4773,11:08,Sorry.
4774,11:08,No actually.
4775,11:08,This is my first semester so I just stopped it for these three courses.
4776,11:08,I'm talking about.
4777,11:08,So what do you
4778,11:08,do graduation is. I took computer science right.
4779,11:08,So I have different courses like senior c c++ Python.
4780,11:08,Likewise network security.
4781,11:09,He taking control equations and then yeah I have differential equations yeah y
4782,11:09,Yeah that's the mathematics curious.
4783,11:09,Yeah drop booty I have differential equations and we have even linear equatio
4784,11:09,it's your turn.
4785,11:09,I just joined this one here.
4786,11:09,Would you mind sharing anything background
4787,11:09,with another course of study. And
4788,11:10,actually I'm very interested in computer security.
4789,11:10,I did CCA. Yeah my most major is in that I did even Cisco certifications. Yes
4790,11:10,And we're we're working on some Google certifications.
4791,11:10,Okay.
4792,11:10,So what. Yeah it's your turn.
4793,11:10,So what causes you opted for the semester.
4794,11:10,On some level in courses that I'm taking a course with MATLAB.
4795,11:10,It's an undergraduate course that's kind of this really is how to program MAT
4796,11:11,Yeah I did but MATLAB. So in physics we did.
4797,11:11,We gain mathematical.
4798,11:11,But I guess what he must be Matt Lauer Yes.
4799,11:11,Yeah it's yeah.
4800,11:11,It's a MATLAB it's a software right we just write the equations all that in
4801,11:11,I have it I love that I did it in my undergraduate.
4802,11:11,I use that on you
4803,11:11,put it in global in course those two to put something on but I mean it's just
4804,11:11,You know that's the what everybody uses for the biomedical engineering stuff
4805,11:11,But honestly I'm taking that on this course.
4806,11:12,I couldn't replace myself because I was trying to replace myself but my my bu
4807,11:12,I thought I would be able to do it by now person.
4808,11:12,Quit prison or the other not ready to quit but they didn't start at the star
4809,11:12,which I think somebody hundred thousand dollars a year for this position you
4810,11:13,Oh it's your turn.
4811,11:12,You just joined it yeah just joined the one. Oh yeah this one right at the t
4812,11:12,Okay.
4813,11:13,Oh that's interesting. I know.
4814,11:13,I'm almost certainly.
4815,11:13,Yeah i don't think anywhere.
4816,11:13,I think I need to give you a block.
4817,11:13,Yeah.
4818,11:13,One.
4819,11:13,gave them. I'll just give you a block.
4820,11:14,So now I continue the
4821,11:14,online.
4822,11:14,I can can you because I've had a blog.
4823,11:14,All of these online.
4824,11:14,Because each time you make your blog. I believe that.
4825,11:14,So but you've actually won.
4826,11:14,I now have to place a line. I'm forced to place the line.
4827,11:14,So
4828,11:14,yeah. What places you.
4829,11:14,You know it's your.
4830,11:15,I need to put your
4831,11:15,lucky use the squiggly line the scribble scribble probably pretty enough okay
4832,11:16,Want me to just scribble it.
4833,11:16,Okay.
4834,11:16,I'll do one.
4835,11:16,Yeah.
4836,11:16,But you take a pencil one.
4837,11:16,So right here.
4838,11:16,Easy.
4839,11:16,on the drop down menu.
4840,11:16,There's a line arrow and scribble
4841,11:16,it.
4842,11:16,Right after Paloma.
4843,11:16,Just have to line one
4844,11:17,right so right next to the arrow where you have a line.
4845,11:17,Yeah.
4846,11:17,I just say Good day all the way to school.
4847,11:17,Yeah okay yeah I go.
4848,11:17,Yeah.
4849,11:18,Yeah.
4850,11:18,Alright so we should get an email with that
4851,11:18,inbox.
4852,11:18,And just check that.
4853,11:19,We require one. The first one that we were just messing around with.
4854,11:19,Yeah.
4855,11:20,And
4856,11:20,the second one. Yeah.
4857,11:20,return we'll be doing the second. Is it the rodney king.
4858,11:20,Oh no I just want to make sure that we're doing it right. So I'm looking for
4859,11:20,Okay.
4860,11:20,I'm running running one right now you want to.
4861,11:20,So we need to play two games actually
4862,11:20,in production.
4863,11:21,Daniel how many games we need to play in total.
4864,11:21,You know with a person to a total we should we should always be trying to be
4865,11:21,Okay actually a person told me my friend told me that we need to play at le
4866,11:21,It will talk to them on a TA.
4867,11:22,On Friday and said just play to two different games with one person for try to
4868,11:22,Yeah.
4869,11:22,I'm not sure I'm supposed to stop the recording at this point but what I guess
4870,11:22,I guess let's just play the second game because it doesn't say anything about
4871,11:22,I think they're both the game should be continuous.
4872,11:23,Okay. I'm sure some data will you know won't translate at least.
4873,11:23,So I guess let's play the second game.
4874,11:23,Okay.
4875,11:23,I don't know exactly if I want to do
4876,11:23,this a long game.
4877,11:23,Shall we play just tic tac toe. It will be completed. So
4878,11:23,we can play checkers.
4879,11:23,Okay that's fine. Me using the sun
4880,11:23,card games that I Oh go to checkers.
4881,11:24,Okay then shall we play checkers this time. Yeah on on card games I Oh g
4882,11:24,Can you please send me the link.
4883,11:24,The same.
4884,11:24,Yeah I got it.
4885,11:24,Yes.
4886,11:24,So when
4887,11:24,you play checkers before.
4888,11:25,I know I didn't know.
4889,11:25,Okay so this is checkers essentially I'm going to a.
4890,11:25,You could only move that ugly.
4891,11:25,And so you select a piece.
4892,11:25,And then you click on where it can go. The object of the game is to skip or ju
4893,11:25,For instance if you had one piece that was at the bottom and a piece that it
4894,11:26,then it will let you or you can skip that many if you get to the opposite fo
4895,11:26,But initially only the piece of pieces are only able to forward.
4896,11:26,And again only dad knowing so in this case we're only going to be moving on t
4897,11:26,Okay.
4898,11:26,Yeah. Hi guys.
4899,11:26,Press OK on the rematch.
4900,11:26,Yeah it's my turn. and I'm going to move one piece.
4901,11:27,So I'm one key setup escape for you So you would essentially take that piec
4902,11:27,Okay.
4903,11:27,And that's how you win the game. Once the other opponent. No more pieces. That
4904,11:27,that you turn.
4905,11:27,Okay
4906,11:27,what classes are you taking this semester.
4907,11:27,Yeah Introduction to computer security cryptography and a
4908,11:27,quantum cryptography you
4909,11:27,know actually we are in.
4910,11:28,I see algorithm and public key cryptography we are.
4911,11:28,Love and Friendship like you saw something called solid state visits. After do
4912,11:28,And they were
4913,11:28,wanting really their work done on purpose but they also be
4914,11:28,was you're interested field.
4915,11:28,I'm like I'm learning really modeling and already
4916,11:28,going for it.
4917,11:29,Like it's the problem.
4918,11:29,Something I say something by I'm really looking at neuroscience.
4919,11:29,That's why I'm
4920,11:29,even start developing
4921,11:29,stuff for like the
4922,11:29,PhD work.
4923,11:29,Are you working on anything that's kind of close to you like this is how I pr
4924,11:29,Like we found some attacks and we need to give some
4925,11:29,like patches type.
4926,11:29,So how we are going to implement to overcome those attacks.
4927,11:30,So for that we are using keystroke dynamics.
4928,11:30,So I'm placing this year now becomes a King crown move backwards.
4929,11:31,Yeah.
4930,11:31,Okay.
4931,11:31,Never played.
4932,11:31,I played but I have no experience a lot of experience.
4933,11:31,You wait just
4934,11:31,yeah I play chess.
4935,11:32,So
4936,11:32,if you have a young you have to take a job.
4937,11:32,So in this scenario I only have one.
4938,11:32,Does that make sense.
4939,11:32,Okay. Yeah.
4940,11:33,Have you been to the United States before.
4941,11:33,Like The United States before.
4942,11:33,No.
4943,11:33,No.
4944,11:33,Are you planning on working in India on the United States.
4945,11:33,Working actually First I want to complete their masters and then I like to ta
4946,11:33,I want to come back again.
4947,11:33,Basically
4948,11:33,kill my refund.
4949,11:34,you're really trying to beat me on.
4950,11:34,You probably
4951,11:34,not much experienced in this game.
4952,11:36,Okay you had no more moon so that's why you can basically trapped on you pla
4953,11:36,Okay.
4954,11:36,Not seeing that scenario
4955,11:36,too long.
4956,11:36,Yeah afraid.
4957,11:36,Now
4958,11:36,now we have to annotate.
4959,11:36,Okay we need to do anything else.
4960,11:36,Yeah. So essentially go ahead and look at it.
4961,11:37,I don't know if you want to reconvene on this one I do have another game.
4962,11:37,But essentially the annotation part we're going to stop this.
4963,11:37,And hopefully
4964,11:37,show where you put the links in the Word
4965,11:37,Excel sheet.
4966,11:37,So you recorded the thing right. Yeah.
